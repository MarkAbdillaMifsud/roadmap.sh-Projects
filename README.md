### [Number Guessing Game](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)

This project is a basic CLI game where the user must guess a number between 1 and 100, which is randomly generated. User may choose a difficulty level, which determines the amount of guesses afforded to the user. User can score points and save lifetime points under different usernames, which are saved to a .csv file.

### [Task Tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

This task tracker uses CLI arguments to maintain a task list JSON, allowing the user to add and delete tasks, update descriptions and status and filter by task progress. 

Commands for the program are as follows:

add <task description>
update <task_id> "new description"
delete <task_id>
mark-to-do <task_id>
